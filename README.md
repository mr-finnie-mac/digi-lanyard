# Digi-Lanyard
### Disability Lanyard Card using ESP + E-Ink Display (LILYGO T5-4.7)
#### Project Objective
An automatic translating lanyard which displays helpful information to people who the user interacts with. Normally, disability lanyards are just plastic and written in the user's own language. This device aims to translate the users given disability information into the language of the country they are visiting. This enables the user a hassle free travel experience with less complications at airports, train stations and bus stops.
